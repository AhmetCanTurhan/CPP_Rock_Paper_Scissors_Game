# Rock-Paper-Scissors (C++ Console Game)

A classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game implementation running in the Command Line Interface (CLI). This project was developed to demonstrate core C++ programming concepts and logic building.

## 🚀 Features

* **Structured Data:** Utilizes `struct` to manage game entities (ID and Name) for cleaner code architecture.
* **Randomized AI:** Implements `srand(time(0))` and `rand()` to ensure the computer's moves are unpredictable every time.
* **Input Validation:** Includes logic to handle invalid user inputs (ensuring the user enters numbers within the 0-2 range).
* **Continuous Gameplay:** Features a `do-while` loop allowing users to play multiple rounds without restarting the application.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Clear console output with ASCII-style separators for better readability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** C++ (Standard 11/14/17/20 compatible)
* **IDE:** Visual Studio / VS Code
* **Libraries:** `<iostream>`, `<string>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<ctime>`

## 💻 How to Run

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AhmetCanTurhan/CPP_Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game.git
    ```
2.  Open the project in **Visual Studio** or any C++ compiler.
3.  Build and Run the `RockPaperScissors.cpp` file.
4.  Follow the on-screen instructions to play against the computer!

## 📝 Learning Outcomes

This project focuses on:
* Understanding **Control Structures** (loops and conditionals).
* Working with **Data Structures** (Arrays and Structs).
* Implementing **Randomness** in game logic.
* Basic **Error Handling** mechanisms.
